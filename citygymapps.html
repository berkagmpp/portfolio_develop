                                for City Gym staff for membership registeration,
                                search, modify, select additional, register, modify, and pay for the fitness class.</p>

                                <p class="fw500">I referred to Jakob Nielsen: 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface
                                    Design (Nielsen, 2020) and then applied the principles to my initial prototype. </p>

                                <p class="ms-3">• As I usually write and watch the web, this prototype is made by
                                    completely web design style.</p>
                                <p class="ms-3">• The application is designed with modern dark mode, which is a trend in
                                    the web field these days (Cardello, 2020). Primarily, used minimal colours of the
                                    dark Gray family to have minimal & aesthetic design. </p>

                                <p class="ms-3">• The overall layout is classified according to consistency and industry
                                    standards.
                                    It also splits the panel by subtle colour differences, allowing users to intuitively
                                    view the entire configuration, eventually making it easier to recognise.</p>

                                <p class="ms-3">• I adopted a sequence and shape that was not too different from the
                                    real-world paper registration form. </p>
                                <p class="ms-3">• The format is similar to the form of the paper version, but this form
                                    posts the registration cost information at the top right, unlike it is located at
                                    the bottom in paper form. The upper right corner is the optimal position for the
                                    user to recognise the structure of the form when scanning the screen (Jerry Cao,
                                    2015, p. 20).
                                    The registration cost information is shown as a sticky that cannot be implemented in
                                    a paper version, allowing follow the screen even if a scroll bar is created. </p>

                                <p class="ms-3">• Breadcrumb placed at the top shows the current user location in the
                                    application and makes it easier for the user to navigate and increase freedom by
                                    connecting easily to upper categories (Gube, 2009).
                                    This location-based Breadcrumb makes it easy to use this application, even if it
                                    will have multiple levels of site structure through many categories or functions are
                                    added later. And the cost display space on the right side, which is the outcome of
                                    the automatically calculated cost, is divided into the price of each item and the
                                    final price, increasing user recognition (Gube, 2009).</p>

                                <p class="ms-3">• The progress indicator was also placed at the top to inform steps and
                                    current status to complete the registration. I will use the chunking technique:
                                    minimizing the overload of information that users need to enter by showing users the
                                    big picture in advance by grouping many data into a large structure (Babich, Web
                                    page design: A comprehensive guide, 2020; Moran, 2016).
                                    This Status Bar shows the present status to allow open and continuous communication
                                    between the user and the application.</p>

                                    accessible for users to understand how to use the registration (Babich, How to write
                                    and design user-friendly error messages, 2020).
                                    It supplies immediate help without requiring user memory.</p>

                                    answer the required value or enter the wrong value into each item. In that case, the
                                    user pressed the Calculate button; the application provides an error solution with
                                    bold red texts and value boxes instinctively raising the user's alertness.
                                    It informs the user of the error as the final outcome (Shamonsky, 2014). </p>

                                <p class="ms-3">• If the user chooses or enters all incorrectly, the user can control
                                    fast and easily via the Reset button next to the Save button without erasing one by
                                    one.
                                    The Reset button has a relatively less noticeable colour and smaller size than the
                                    Save button, preventing unintentional pressing (Babich, Web page design: A
                                    comprehensive guide, 2020).</p>
                                <p class="ms-3">• When the Reset button and the Save button are pressed, the
                                    confirmation dialogue window asks the user once more whether to reset/save or cancel
                                    the data entered and then executed.
                                    It reduces involuntary mistakes, providing efficiency and convenience to users
